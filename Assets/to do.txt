-chip text isn't being set in matchmaking screen (hopefully fixed)

-game needs to be able to end and start again
-option to leave game / not join the next one
-both players can call once too much on showdown round (hopefully fixed)
-ui for wrong password etc
-user chips are set instead of modified



worries for later:
-cancel screen pops up too soon, pops up again when you press it quickly
-if big blind calls (checks) on r1, small blind gets to check again (does work if small blind raises)
-onapplicationquit = fold, leave, cleanup
-registering
-joining mid game shenanigans
